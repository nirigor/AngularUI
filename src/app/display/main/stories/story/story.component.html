    <p>You have lived in the building's top floor for five years. Apart from the neighbor who lives opposite your apartment, 
        your relationship with the rest of your neighbors is great. You struggle to understand why you can't get along with the opposite neighbor.</p>
    <p>In last month's building meeting, the opposite neighbor expressed his desire to build a room on the building rooftop for his newborn baby. 
        This isn't the first time the opposite neighbor wants to use the common area on the rooftop for his personal needs. 
        Last year the opposite neighbor used the rooftop as a temporary guesthouse without the consent of the other tenants. 
        You voted against the neighbor's plan, claiming the rooftop should remain the common area. 
        The neighbor quickly replied, “you will regret this”. The next morning the opposite neighbour sent a message to the building's WhatsApp group saying, 
        “they don't care about the welfare of babies; they only care about themselves”. 
        You were hurt by this message since you have nothing against babies and are happy to get along with the other tenants. 
        You tried to explain to the opposite neighbour that it has nothing to do with the baby; it's just the fact you believe the common area should stay common. 
        The neighbour ignored your calls and hung up a poster regarding your vote in the building's lobby, damaging your good name. 
        You tried to ask the neighbour to stop spreading false lies about you, but he denied your request.</p>
    <p>You want to maintain a good relationship with the other tenants. 
        You struggle to understand why the opposite neighbor won't cooperate, and you would like a civilized relationship between you. 
        You would like the neighbor to stop spreading lies and apologize for the posters and false messages he wrote.</p>

    <p>You took out a loan from the bank with your spouse, and to ensure its repayment, you registered a mortgage on the residential apartment you own. 
        At the same time, you purchased an insurance policy from an insurance company designed to ensure repayment of the loan by you in case of a material change in your life. 
        Over the years, you have fallen behind on several payments, so you contacted the bank and changed the loan terms. After a while, your spouse died unexpectedly in a car accident. 
        Beyond your difficult mental state in light of their passing, the insurance company paid you only part of the loan amount. 
        The amount was calculated according to the original loan and not the amount after the change. 
        The insurance company claims that you were only insured for the lower amount according to the original loan.</p>
    <p>According to you, the insurance company is obliged to pay the entire amount. Also, the bank's duty was to inform you if it was necessary to update the insurance policy. 
        You couldn't know about it yourself. According to the bank, the insurance policy states that the insurance coverage will be in the amount and conditions specified in the bank's records, 
        so in their opinion, there was no need for further updating by the insurance company.</p>
    <p>You're disappointed with the bank for not telling you that the insurance policy needs to be updated when the loan terms are changed, 
        and you're disappointed with the insurance company and its insensitive answers. Your mental state is precarious in light of your spouse's death. 
        In addition, you feel that the bank and the insurance company are shifting the responsibility from one to the other, leaving you alone in the battle.</p>

    <p>You are engaged in financial activities.</p>
    <p>Over 10 years ago, you decided to deposit 31,000 USD in cash into a foreign currency account at the bank, which you opened the same day. 
        In the confirmation of opening the account, it explicitly stated that it is impossible to withdraw the deposit before three months have passed,
         not even to transfer money abroad.</p>
    <p>You recently went to withdraw the funds; you were told there was no deposit in your name because the account was reset and converted. 
        It turned out that less than two months after the deposit, $30,563 was converted from the account, followed by another 437 USD. 
        Although these conversions were carried out before the end of the three months, the bank did not charge any fees or penalties.</p>
    <p>You were shocked and claimed that you were abroad at the time of the transactions made from the account and did not confirm the transactions.</p>
    <p>The bank, on its behalf, 
        confirms that it does not have the other documents pertaining to the account history and where your money was converted since it has been a long time since the deposit.</p>
    <p>You want to finish the procedure quickly since you are not staying in the country for a long period of time and will not be able to conduct many procedures remotely. 
        You are a wealthy person, and it is especially important to you that the bank cares for you and its other customers.</p>

        You used to spend time together and go on joint trips with your families.</p> 
    <p>A few months ago, your son went for a walk with your three dogs, the dogs tied on a leash that allows a relative freedom of movement.
        When your son passed by John Doe's house, one of the dogs walked towards the gate and began to sniff in the area. When the dog was close to the gate, 
        John Doe's dog (a large hunting dog) suddenly jumped towards the gate and from between the bars, grabbed your dog and bit him hard in the face.
        At that moment, your son ran to free the dog from the animal's teeth, and when he released him from her grip, he saw that the dog's face was bleeding badly. 
        You immediately went to the veterinary hospital to treat the injured dog.</p>    
    <p>After several hours of treatments and emergency surgery on the dog, they managed to save his life, but the dog lost one of his eyes and a scar remained on his face.</p> 
    <p>When you returned from the veterinary hospital with the dog, you decided to call John Doe. 
        He answered the phone but, apperantly was afraid that you might record the conversation and use it against him if the case reached the court. 
        In addition, he claimed that he did not think he was to blame for the incident because his dog was in his private garden with the gate was locked. </p>
    <p>John's response offends you since you just wanted to hear his side of the story and possibly get an apology.</p>

    <p>Your first daughter was born a year ago. Since you and your spouse are both working parents, you've decided to send your daughter to the local nursery school. 
        You were a bit hesitant since there's only one kindergarten teacher who oversees over ten toddlers, but the fact that they had additional assistants to support the teacher eased your concern. 
        The teacher assuaged your concerns when she said: "you have nothing to worry about. Every toddler gets special attention at our nursery school".</p>
    <p>One day, you met one of the teacher's assistants at the local grocery store. 
        The assistant claimed the teacher doesn't look after the children properly since she yells at the toddlers and doesn't change their diapers when needed.
        You felt hurt by the news since the teacher promised to pay special attention to every toddler at her nursery school, and your daughter's health and safety are at stake.</p>
    <p>Consequently, you quickly assembled a parent's meeting and told the rest of the parents about your conversation with the assistant. 
        One of the parents remarked that you must consider that the teacher and the assistant were never on good terms, and therefore we must think carefully about whether to believe the assistant. 
        Several parents expressed their concern about this occurrence and said they were not satisfied with the teacher's conduct.</p>
    <p>Considering the many problems raised, you've decided to withdraw your daughter from the nursery school to ensure her health and safety. 
        You have also demanded the teacher refund the full tuition costs. The teacher denied all the claims above and held that no payment should be made to parents withdrawing their kids from the nursery school.</p>
    <p>You believe that you ought to get back the money paid in advance for your daughter's tuition since she is not attending the nursery school anymore. 
        In addition to an acknowledgment of your concern, worry, anger, and breach of trust following the ordeal.</p>

    <p>You have been buying and selling shares in the capital market through your bank for years. 
        Your relationship with the bank representative is excellent, and there has never been a problem regarding your instructions concerning the sale and purchase of shares.</p>
    <p>You have recently been interested in a particular stock that you own. You have spent many hours analyzing the stock's fluctuations. 
        After much research and thought, you have concluded that the stock should be sold immediately since the share's value will fall drastically at any moment. 
        You called the bank representative and explained to him your desire to sell all the shares of this type immediately. 
        A bank representative replied, "No problem, I'll sell them immediately." In practice, you discovered that the bank representative only sold your shares the next day, causing you to lose a lot of money.</p>
    <p>You tried to contact the bank to reach some settlement concerning the serious malfunction that you believed occurred. 
        Still, the bank representative denied the fact that you asked him to sell immediately and did not agree to pay compensation for the significant loss caused. 
        You have been greatly offended by the action and attitude of the representative, as you have had a great relationship over the years. You are shocked by his denial of your explicit request. 
        It is also worth mentioning that replacing bank investments involves investing tremendous amounts of time and resources.</p>

        You were very happy because you waited and put a lot of time into it. Eventually, after much search effort, you found a construction company selling apartments in the city you wanted. 
        After a while, it turned out that the construction company went bankrupt, and you don't know where you stand and what will happen to its construction obligations to you.</p>

         and in none of the meetings did the bank bother to mention that the construction company is its customer. The bank didn't even recommend consulting other parties before purchasing the apartment.

    <p>You are the main source of income for your family. You recently took out a mortgage with your spouse from the bank to buy an apartment. 
        According to the agreement with the bank and the contractor of the apartment, you must pay the contractor the agreed amount once a month by bank checks. 
        Every month, you contact the bank, apply for a check, the bank approves and contacts the contractor, and the latter collects the check from the bank and puts it in his account.</p> 
    <p>In the previous month, your check request was approved and forwarded to the contractor by the bank clerk as usual. After a short time, the clerk who handled this check resigned, and a new clerk took office. 
        The new clerk saw your request for a check the previous month, thought that the request had not been processed, and approved another check without contacting you or clarifying the request's status.</p>
    <p>The clerk contacted the contractor, and the latter collected and cashed the additional check. Due to the clerk's mistake at the bank, you were charged twice that month. 
        You contacted the bank about the double charge that was made in error, and he replied that the matter was under investigation and in the meantime, you should contact the contractor.</p>
    <p>Several months have passed, and the bank has not yet dealt with the problem and keeps replying that it will investigate the matter. The bank is not taking responsibility.</p>

    <p>Two months after commencing work at a soft drink factory, 
        you experienced a workplace accident resulting in an injury and partial amputation of one of your fingers, 
        entailing a certain degree of disability. Following the incident, during which you bled and cried for assistance, 
        the shift manager — who happened to be the son of one of the factory owners — attended to your injury 
        by wrapping your finger with a fabric bandage. Despite your distress, 
        he requested you to wait until the end of the shift so that they could transport you to the hospital.</p>
    <p>Upon completion of the shift, you were driven to a hospital close to the shift manager's residence, 
        which was significantly distant from your own. 
        The medical professionals at the hospital deemed an urgent operation necessary, and after the surgery, 
        you remained in the hospital for an additional two days. Throughout this period, 
        neither the factory's representatives nor anyone from the management bothered to visit or inquire about your well-being — 
        both during your hospital stay and upon your return to work.</p>
    <p>This lack of concern and the offensive attitude exhibited by the factory representatives deeply hurt both you and your family. 
        In an attempt to address the situation, the factory owner visited you at your parents' house and extended an apology for the shift manager's conduct. 
        However, the employer asserted that there was no negligence in their behavior. 
        Instead, it was acknowledged that the care and attitude displayed were inadequate.</p>

        In response, your partner suggested buying your share, and you, aiming for an amicable resolution, agreed to the proposal.</p>
    <p>However, after a few days, you reconsidered and realized that selling to your business partner might not be the most favorable option for you. 
        You believed that selling the business to a third party could potentially fetch a better price and offer greater financial benefits. 
        When you communicated this change of heart to your partner, he became furious, asserting that you had a binding agreement to sell your share exclusively to him.</p>
    <p>Moreover, he claimed that by entertaining the idea of selling to a third party, you recklessly exposed the business to risk. 
        Allegedly, clients who learned about the internal conflicts expressed their intention to leave, causing significant damage. 
        He contends that you are responsible for compensating him for these perceived losses, as well as for the damage to the business's reputation.</p>

    <p>After saving a considerable amount from your monthly salary, you finally purchased an expensive high-end gaming computer that cost thousands of dollars. 
        Through extensive research, you identified the perfect model that suited your needs, complete with a two-year warranty.</p>
    <p>However, shortly after using the computer, you observed rapid overheating issues, necessitating breaks during gaming sessions to let it cool down. 
        Upon contacting the company, you requested a replacement with a different model to avoid overheating problems, but your request was denied. Instead, they advised you to send it to their repair lab for inspection.</p>
    <p>Following a two-week period, the computer returned from the lab with a certificate indicating it had tested fine. 
        Unfortunately, upon resuming use, the severe overheating issue recurred. 
        Again contacting customer service, you demanded a replacement, but the representative insisted on returning it to the lab for additional testing. 
        You find this process illogical, as sending back the same defective computer for more vague lab testing seems counterproductive.</p>
    <p>You firmly believe that you are entitled to a replacement computer, but the customer service agent refused, asserting that the warranty only covers repairs and not replacements in cases like yours. 
        This ongoing back-and-forth with the computer company is proving to be time-consuming and mentally exhausting.</p>

    <p>As a professional pianist owning a precious 19th-century grand piano, you recently enlisted the services of a moving company to carefully transport this sensitive and valuable instrument from your old apartment to your new home.</p>
    <p>Regrettably, the movers neglected to inform you in real time about damage sustained during the move. Only after the piano was delivered did you discover, on your own, that several original and antique components had been broken.</p>
    <p>The moving company failed to disclose the damage upfront, compelling you to order expensive replacement parts to attempt to repair the piano as much as possible. 
        Despite your efforts, a significant gap will persist, as the new parts can never precisely replace what was lost.</p>
    <p>This situation represents a devastating blow for you as a professional musician, as the sound and qualities of the piano have been irreversibly compromised.</p>
