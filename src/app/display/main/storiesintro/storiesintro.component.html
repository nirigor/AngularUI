            <p>
                One of the ways to resolve a conflict is through adjudication.
                In adjudication, you and the other party will need a lawyer to represent you in front of the judge.
                This procedure usually takes time…
                Since it involves lawyers and other experts this procedure is usually expensive.
                You have no control over the process or the outcome - a dispute that starts in adjudication can end in a different procedure (e.g., mediation, negotiation, etc. ).
                there is no privacy! usually all the information regarding the conflict and the judgement are publically available.
                The outcome is final - a judge gives a final judgment at the end.
                The conflict will be resolved at the end.

            <p>
                One of the ways to resolve a conflict is through mediation. In mediation, the parties in the conflict turn to a third party, a neutral mediator, who will help and direct them toward an agreement without the authority to give a final decision. 
                A mediation process includes the parties of the dispute, the mediator, and sometimes the parties' attorneys. 
                The procedure is usually short and cost effective. During mediation, the parties can talk and express their feelings and needs. 
                Participation in the mediation procedure depends on the consent of the parties. Either party can terminate the mediation and must agree to conclude the process with an agreement. 
                An agreement can include creative solutions that will allow both parties to benefit from the solution. The procedure is confidential and not public. 
                The parties cannot use anything said or done in mediation if they take the case to court.

            <p>
                One of the ways to resolve a conflict is through negotiation. In negotiation the parties focus on exchanging of proposals to the point of convergence to a compromise point. Negotiation is conducted without the involvement of a neutral third party. 
                The outcome, and the certainty at the end depend solely on the parties and whether they have reached an agreement acceptable to both. The procedure is usually short and cost effective. This process requires cooperation between the parties. 
                Either party can terminate the negotiation and must agree to conclude the process with an agreement. The procedure is confidential and not public.

            <p>
                One of the ways to resolve a conflict is through arbitration. In arbitration, the parties in the conflict turn to a third party, a neutral arbitrator, who eventually gives a final and binding decision. 
                Participation in the arbitration procedure depends on the consent of the parties.  There are restrictions on the possibility of appealing or overturning the arbitrator's decision. The procedure is usually short, but it is costly. 
                The procedure is confidential and not public.

            <p class="mtop0"><b>What is a Public Complaint?</b></p>
            <p>
                One of the ways to resolve a conflict is by submitting a complaint to an auditing body. In this procedure, a party affected by wrongdoing applies to a neutral body responsible for investigating complaints against certain entities (usually companies or public bodies). 
                Applying to an auditing body can lead to a correction or change in the conduct that caused the injustice or a broad change in conduct in the future, but it usually cannot end in compensation.
                The complaining party has no control over the process or the outcome, and his involvement is usually limited. The cost invested in this procedure is low, but the duration of investigating the complaint can be long. 
                The procedure is confidential and not public. The procedure's outcome depends on the auditing body, not the parties.

            <p>
                One of the ways to resolve a conflict is by avoidance – “letting go”. Choosing to avoid conflict sometimes means a waiver of rights. Avoiding conflict depends on the party itself and will allow a reduction of stress. Also, the costs involved are minimal.
